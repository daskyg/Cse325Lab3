Lab Methods:
Task1 & Task 2:
Added two system calls to syscall.h:
#define SYS_cps    22
#define SYS_chpr   23

In the struct proc in the proc.h file, add a new attribute ‘priority’, to represent nice number.
Added sys calls to defs.h and user.h
//Inside proc.c
int		cps(void);
int 		chpr(int pid, int priority);

//Inside the system calls section in users.h
int cps(void);
int chpr(int pid, int priority);

Included the definition of the cps and chpr functions in proc.c

In sysproc.c, defined  a function in which our cps and chpr functions will be called:
int sys_cps(void)
{
  return cps();
}

int sys_chpr(void)
{
  int pid, pr;
  if(argint(0, &pid) < 0)
    return -1;
  if(argint(1, &pr) < 0)
    return -1;

  return chpr(pid, pr);
}

Added changes in the usys.S file:
SYSCALL(cps)
SYSCALL(chpr)

Add the two system calls to sysproc.c:
//This is where other system calls are defined in syscall.c
extern int sys_cps(void);
extern int sys_chpr(void);

//This is inside static int (*syscalls[])(void)
[SYS_cps]     sys_cps,
[SYS_chpr]    sys_chpr,

Edited  the allocproc function in proc.c, to assign default priority:

found:
  p->state = EMBRYO;
  p->pid = nextpid++;
  p->priority = 10;  //Default Priority of a process is set to be 10


Next, we created the ps.c and nice.c file in which our cps and chpr functions are called

Made changes to makefile, added following under UPROGS section
_ps\ 
_lab3test\ 
_nice\

Task 3:
Modified lab3Test.c (?):


Task 4:
To accomplish the functionality of this section the scheduler function in proc.c will be replaced with the one below for priority round robin scheduling

void
scheduler(void)
{
  struct proc *p, *p1;
  struct cpu *c = mycpu();
  c->proc = 0;
  
  for(;;){
    // Enable interrupts on this processor.
    sti();
    struct proc *highP;
    // Loop over process table looking for process to run.
    acquire(&ptable.lock);
    for(p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++){
      if(p->state != RUNNABLE)
        continue;

      // Switch to chosen process.  It is the process's job
      // to release ptable.lock and then reacquire it
      // before jumping back to us.
      highP = p;
      //choose one with highest priority
      for(p1 = ptable.proc; p1 < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p1++){
	if(p1->state != RUNNABLE)
	  continue;
	if(highP->priority > p1->priority)   //larger value, lower priority
	  highP = p1;
      }
      p = highP;
      c->proc = p;
      switchuvm(p);
      p->state = RUNNING;

      swtch(&(c->scheduler), p->context);
      switchkvm();

      // Process is done running for now.
      // It should have changed its p->state before coming back.
      c->proc = 0;
    }
    release(&ptable.lock);

  }
}

Lab Results:

Task 1:
ps
 --> 5
 --> 5
 --> 5
fork --> 1
sbrk --> 12
exec --> 7
3 ps: unknown sys call 24
wait --> 3
$write --> 16
 write --> 16

	Task 2:
 Before changing nice value:
	ps
 --> 5
 --> 5
 --> 5
fork --> 1
sbrk --> 12
exec --> 7
10 ps: unknown sys call 24
wait --> 3
$write --> 16
 write --> 16

After changing nice value:
		Ps
 --> 5
 --> 5
 --> 5
fork --> 1
sbrk --> 12
exec --> 7
12 ps: unknown sys call 24
wait --> 3
$write --> 16
 write --> 16


Task 3:

Modified lab3test.c so that the parent process waits for the children to finish. This is done so that the round robin scheduling can be observed with cps.

ps 	 15 	 RUNNING 	 10 	 

When you run the first command you are creating 3 child processes indicated by the RUNNABLE/RUNNING label.
As you can see by the outputs of the ps commands the process that is running changes meaning the CPU is doing 
some context switching and scheduling different processes.

Note: Me and my partner agreed that I would do the odd tasks and he would do the even tasks.
      We planned on asking each other for help if it was needed. 

The biggest problem I ran into was when I was testing the round robin scheduling. 
I often got the same process in the RUNNING state when I ran ps. This made me think
that there was some problem with the scheduler. Upon closer look I just needed to run ps
more times, then I could see that it was scheduling properly.

This lab felt very similar to lab 2, and so wasn’t very difficult to complete, as we were simply editing xv6 again. The only issues came from creating the priority based scheduler, as implementing that algorithm by itself takes a minute to get your head around and implementing it in xv6 is a whole other issue.
